=head1 NAME

Acme::Dump::And::Dumper - dump data structures without seeing any object guts

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Acme::Dump::And::Dumper;

    my $data = {
        foo => 'bar',
        ber => {
            beer => [qw/x y z/],
            obj  => bless([], 'Foo::Bar'),
        },
    };

    print DnD $data;

    ## Prints:
    ## $VAR1 = {
    ##      'ber' => {
    ##                 'obj' => 'obj[Foo::Bar]',
    ##                 'beer' => [
    ##                             'x',
    ##                             'y',
    ##                             'z'
    ##                           ]
    ##               },
    ##      'foo' => 'bar'
    ## };

    # All the Data::Dumper stuff is still there...
    $Data::Dumper::Useqq = 1;
    print DnD "Foo\nBar";

    # ... even the original Dumper()
    print Dumper "Foo\nBar";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A L<Data::Dumper>, with an additional sub that's like C<Dumper()>
but doesn't dump the contents of object refs.

=head1 EXPORTS

In addition to all the stuff available for export in L<Data::Dumper>,
this module provides C<DnD()> function (pneumonic: "Dump'n'Dumper").

=head2 C<DnD>

    print DnD $data;

    # Data::Dumper's vars are still available:
    $Data::Dumper::Useqq = 1;
    print DnD "Foo\nBar";

Takes the same stuff and returns the same output as
C<Data::Dumper::Dumper()>, except all of the
objects will be replaced with C<obj[Foo::Bar]>, where C<Foo::Bar> is
object's class. B<See caveats section below>.

=head1 CAVEATS

Whenever possible, the module will try to deep clone the structure
before messing with it and dumping it. B<However>, since not everything
is deep clonable, it fails to deep clone, the module will modify the original data structure, and method call on what B<used to be> objects
will obviously fail.

=head1 HISTORY

This module arose from my frustration of trying to get rid of object
guts in my dumped data (e.g. dumping C<Foo::Bar> that is a blessed
hashref, would also dump all the contents of that hashref).
Subsequently, during a conversation on IRC, C<tm604> came up with
a hack using C<$Data::Dumper::Freezer>, and the following comment
from C<hoelzro> made me decide to release a module I could actually
use, when I don't want to see any object guts.

    <hoelzro> Data::Dumper::And::Dumper
    * hoelzro ducks
    <hoelzro> s/Dumper/Dump/ # ruined my own awful joke

P.S.: eventually I ended up using L<Data::Rmap> instead of the Freezer.
